    <!-- Artwork description -->
    <div class="artwork-description">
      <p>A wooden shield shatters into a million little pieces, its inscription — “ghosting just feels good” — rendered nearly unreadable. The skillful precision with which the lettering and decorative elements of the individual fragments are executed stands in stark contrast to the desperation evoked by the seemingly sudden, explosive destruction of the material, as well as to the comical, almost cynical nature of the message, reminiscent of a fortune-cookie slip or a motivational meme.</p>
      <p>Gajewski’s work with language, draws equally on pop culture and folk psychology in humorous, emotional, and unexpected ways, invites us in by promising thoughtless comfort of a recognizable aesthetic in familiar visuals and phrases. Yet on closer examination it delivers a hidden range of genuine and sometimes overwhelming emotions, refusing to romanticize or aestheticize the frictions, discomforts, and complexities of interpersonal relationships.</p>
